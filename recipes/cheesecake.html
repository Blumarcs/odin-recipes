        <h2>A light no bake cheesecake</h2>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Graham Cracker crust</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream or heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>27oz cream cheese, room temperature</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir the graham cracker crust ingredients together. Pour into a 9-inch springform pan or 10-inch springform pan and pack in very tightly. The tighter it's packed, the less likely it will fall apart when cutting the cheesecake. I recommend using the bottom of a measuring cup to pack it into the bottom and up the sides. You can watch me do this in the video above. Freeze for 10-20 minutes as you prepare the filling.</li>
            <li>Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the cold heavy cream into stiff peaks on medium-high speed, about 4-5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium speed until perfectly smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed. Add the confectioners' sugar, sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla extract. Beat for 2-3 minutes on medium-high speed until smooth and combined. Make sure there are no large lumps of cream cheese. If there are lumps, keep beating until smooth.</li>
            <li>Using your mixer on low speed or a silicone spatula, fold the whipped cream into the cheesecake filling until combined. This takes several turns of your silicone spatula. Combine slowly as you don't want to deflate all the air in the whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Remove crust from the freezer and spread filling into crust. Use an offset spatula to smooth down the top.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and refrigerate for at least 6-8 hours and up to 2 days. For best results, 12 hours is best. I chill mine overnight. The longer refrigerated, the nicer the no-bake cheesecake will set up.</li>
            <li>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean between each slice.</li>
            <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is an easy recipe that will only take a short amount of time to put together, no oven required. Just beat all the wet ingredients together and spread them on the graham cracker crust and refrigerate until it is settled. You only need two bowls for this!.</p>
