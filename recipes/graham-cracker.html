        <h2>A crunchy homemade Graham Cracker</h2>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>2 tbsp molasses or honey</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups white whole wheat flour, plus extra for rolling</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>With a hand mixer or stand mixer, cream butter, honey, and molasses together. Beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the ingredients and mix on low speed. The mixture will look crumbly at first. Add 2 tablespoons of milk and mix until a dough forms. If it looks dry still, add another tablespoon of milk.</li>
            <li>Shape into a flat disc and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Chilling the dough will make it easier to roll out so do not skip this step.</li>
            <li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350°F. Take the dough out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to make it easier to work with. Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface.</li>
            <li>Lightly sprinkle with a small amount of flour. Place dough in the center and place a second sheet of parchment paper on top. Roll from the center outwards, using light, even pressure and turning the dough occasionally to maintain an even thickness, about ⅛ inch is ideal. The thinner you roll it, the crispier the crackers will be. And try your best to roll it into a rectangular shape.</li>
            <li>Using a pizza cutter, trim the sides and cut into 2x3 inch rectangles.</li>
            <li>Transfer the entire parchment paper (there's no need to separate the rectangles). Prick each cracker with a fork to create the signature graham cracker dotted pattern.</li>
            <li>Bake for 14-17 minutes, until golden brown. They may seem soft but will crisp up as it cools so cool completely and break them into individual crackers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These are easy graham crackers to make will taste better than your store bought variations. Allow yourself to put any type of toppings on it after they have finished being baked. Try not to eat them all in one day.</p>
